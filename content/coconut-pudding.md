## Tools needed

-   Bowls
-   A pot or pan
-   Something that can stir stuff like a metal spoon or a spatula

## Ingredients

-   1/2 cup of hot water
-   4 envelopes (about 1oz/28g total) of gelatine powder
-   1 can (about 400ml) of coconut milk (can be lite)
-   1 cup of milk (can be vegan)
-   your choice of sweetener (I use a mix of brown sugar, honey, and rock sugar)
-   vanilla extract

## Directions

1. Stir the gelatine powder in hot water (hot water means boiled) until dissolved (or mostly dissolved).

2. Simmer coconut milk and milk in pan or pot over medium heat. Turn down heat, if needed, to make sure it does not boil.

3. Dissolve sweetener 1 tablespoon at a time into simmering mixture until desired sweetness is achieved via a spoon taste test. I used about 3 tablespoons total.

4. Add some vanilla extract, if desired. I eyeball the amount myself, but feel free to just add 1/2 a teaspoon.

5. Stir gelatine mixture into simmering mixture until completely mixed. Reminder to **not let it boil**.

6. Pour mixture into some (not plastic) container, like a bowl or some sort of baking dish. I used glass tuppleware from the dollar store.

7. Let the mixture cool for about 30 minutes before putting it into the fridge overnight (or about 5-6 hours).

8. If not serving to friends, just eat it out of the container with a spoon. Otherwise, run a knife around the container to loosen pudding and pour it carefully onto a large plate or cutting board. Once out of the container, cut the pudding as desired.
