# Tools needed

-   Bowls (one of them needs to be fairly large for the whipped cream)
-   Saucepan
-   Whisk
-   Tall baking dish to hold the assembled tiramisu

# Ingredients

## Crème anglaise

-   3 egg yolk (egg whites can be scrambled for a snack)
-   1/4 cup sugar
-   1/2 cup of milk of your choice
-   vanilla extract or vanilla bean

## Whipped cream

-   3/4 cup of heavy cream
-   1/4 cup of white sugar
-   8oz pack of mascarpone cheese

## Rest

-   1 pack of lady fingers
-   1 cup of your favorite cup of coffee or matcha tea
    -   When I make this for a friend, I usually ask them what their favorite coffee is
-   cocoa powder or matcha powder

# Directions

## Crème anglaise

1. Beat egg yolks until smooth in bowl.

2. Add sugar and beat some more.

3. Heat milk in sauce pan until simmer or sub simmer. **Stir constantly**. The point is for the milk to be warm, but not to the point where you get the milk skin.

4. Take milk off heat. **Important** Spoon 3 spoonfuls of warm milk at a time into egg yolk. The goal here is to **very** slowly bring up the temperature of the egg yolk so they do not cook.

5. Add vanilla. I usually eyeball, but 1/4 teaspoon or 1 bean is good if you want something exact.

6. Bring mixture back to saucepan and stir constantly while heating at lowest heat until thickened. **Stir constantly. Do not let the egg yolk cook too much (it is unavoidable that some cooks).**

7. (Optional) Strain the completed creme anglaise. I usually do not do this because I hate cleaning the strainer, but it can improve texture.

## Whipped cream

1. In a large bowl (larger than you'd expect), whisk heavy cream. Over time it would form into something thick. It's best to watch a video of how heavy cream is whipped.

2. As the heavy cream thickens, add sugar while whisking in 3 batches.

3. When peaks are medium, add mascarpone cheese.

4. Whisk until stiff peaks.

## Rest

1. Carefully fold crème anglaise into whipped cream/mascarpone mixture.

2. Layer the tiramisu into a tall dish (like a baking dish) accordingly. There should be at least 2 repetitions.

    - 1 layer of soaked lady fingers
        - The lady fingers can either be soaked by quickly dipping them into the drink or by spooning the drink over them. It depends on how moist you like your tiramisu. I personally like it moist.
    - 1 layer of the crème anglaise mixture
    - 1 layer of cocoa powder or matcha powder
        - There is no rule on how much is too much, but I try to keep it as thin as possible.

3. Leave tiramisu in the fridge overnight.
